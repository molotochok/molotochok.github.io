This application is created with Angular and is basically my portfolio.

## To deploy project

1. Simply run `ng build --prod`
1. Make a copy of `docs/index.html` and name it `docs/404.html` (Not sure if this needs to be done every time. It should solve the 404 issue after page reloading)
1. Commit and push changes
